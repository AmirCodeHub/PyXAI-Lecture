## Introduction: Using Jupyter Notebook via Anaconda for the Assignment

Welcome to your assignment! For this task, we will be using Jupyter Notebook, an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. We will access the Jupyter Notebook through Anaconda, a powerful and easy-to-use open-source distribution of Python.

Anaconda greatly simplifies the process of installing and managing the different software dependencies for data science and machine learning. Here's a simple guide to get you started:

## 1. Installation
- Download Anaconda: Go to the [Anaconda Installations](https://www.anaconda.com/download) page, and download the version that suits your system and Python version preference. We recommend using Python 3.x.

- Install Anaconda: Run the installer file and follow the instructions. If you are unsure about any settings, accept the defaults. They can be changed later.

## 2. Launching Jupyter Notebook
- Open Anaconda Navigator: After installation, you can open Anaconda Navigator from your programs/applications menu. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing packages and environments and launching applications.

- Launch Jupyter Notebook: From the Anaconda Navigator, click on the Jupyter Notebook icon. A new browser window will open with the Jupyter file browser.

- Navigate and Launch: From the file browser, you can navigate to the directory containing your assignment notebook file (.ipynb extension), and click on it to open.
